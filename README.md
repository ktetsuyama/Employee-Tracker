## Introduction

As a business owner, the client wants to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in the company so that they can organize and plan their business

## Problem

The business owner needs a way to view different department, role, and employee information, add new departments, roles, and employees, or update an employee's role directly in the database, but with a more user friendly interface than using MySQL in the terminal.

## Solution

I created an Inquirer prompt set to allow the user to accomplish the desired functions mentioned above.

Here is a video of the application in action:
